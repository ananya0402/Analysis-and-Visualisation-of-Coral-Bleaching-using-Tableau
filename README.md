# Analysis and Visualisation of Coral Bleaching using Tableau

The data shows coral bleaching data for 8 sites in the Great Barrier Reef. It gives the % of bleaching for different kinds of coral: hard corals, sea pens, blue corals, soft corals and sea fans over the last 8 years (though not all sites have data for the entire period, and not all corals are found at each site).

The task involved exploring the data and determining:

Q1) In which years and for which kinds of coral bleaching is the worst

Q2) How the location of the site affects bleaching on the different kinds of coral

* Check the data for entry errors
* The report contains two parts:
  * Data wrangling: Detail any reformatting/wrangling, checking, and cleaning you performed on the data
  * Data exploration: Describe how you explored the data (include images of the visualisations you created In Tableau during this process), and give your answers to the questions with supporting reasons and visualisations
